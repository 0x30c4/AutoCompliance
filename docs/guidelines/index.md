# Development and Contribution Guidelines [WIP]
Here you will find guidelines on the various ways you can contribute back to 
the project. You do not have to follow these guidelines to the letter, but it 
would be most recommended that you do.

## Development Environment
PyCharm IDE with native libraries and Python 3.10 installation on a Fedora 35 
host machine.

## Coding Standards And Best Practices
Following the native PyCharm linter and CodeQL feedback as part of Git Actions.

## Build Process [WIP]
Being researched as of 06/03/2022 but so far it's looking like Flatpak for 
Linux, .exe for Windows and .app for MacOS.
